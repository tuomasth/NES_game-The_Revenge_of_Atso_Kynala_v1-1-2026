Atso Kynälä is a nerd who has been imprisoned by his bully. One day, when the bully went to see how Atso is doing, dangerous bugs had appeared. The bully was frightened and his coins dropped on the floor.
Atso sure will enjoy when jumping on the worthless coins. That will be his revenge - but he must not run out of time. With the help of a pencil, he can get more speed (on the other hand, he loses speed in getting score).

Instructions for playing:
- Download an emulator such as FCEUX (https://fceux.com/web/home.html).
- Download "therevengeofatsokynala.nes".
- Open the file with the emulator.
- Configure the buttons as you like and start playing. The game does not use Select, A and B at all.

There is no music. The only two sound effects are 1) pausing and 2) taking damage. The game does not use a save battery. No scrolling. This is a very small game (24 KB). 
The goal is to get the maximum score. If the game feels too easy, Player 2 can annoy Player 1 by controlling the antagonist.

You can also make a real NES cartridge with the PRG and CHR bin-files. Thanks for trying out this game!

Quick instructions for re-programming the game:
- Open "therevengeofatsokynala.asm" and make the edits. The file opens with Windows Notepad, for example.
- Double-click "atsokynala.bat". That calls "NESASM3.exe" with the commands "NESASM3 therevengeofatsokynala.asm" and "pause".
- A new NES file should be created after this if there were no errors. Open the NES file with an emulator and see if you achieved what you wanted.

For editing the graphics, there is the file "therevengeofatsokynala.chr". There are unused graphics that were not necessary after all.

I do not own NESASM3. NESASM3 can be downloaded for example from "https://www.patater.com/gbaguy/day1n.htm". The program has also been available on other sites. NintendoAge and NesDev.org helped when programming.
NES splitter from "romhacking.net" was used in separating the PRG and CHR files from the NES file.
